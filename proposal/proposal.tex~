\section{Objective}
Our objective in collecting urban data and subsequently classifying cities is to
enumerate typologies with distinct mobility, energy and emissions
footprints. Furthermore, these typologies should readily produce canonical or
representative cities to facilitate scenario analyses and also provide bases for
simulating mobility outcomes where real data is infeasible to access.

The indicators of interest will be broadly related to the following areas:
economy, environment, geography and health. While some have been standardized,
there will be many that are not. An initial step will therefore be to properly
curate data from the disparate sources (global, regional, national and private).

Relatively few efforts exist on urban typologization in the peer-reviewed
literature. Many of the extant works are geared toward socioeconomics, but we
note that the work done by \citet{priester2013diversity} is one of the most
relevant for mobility.  Yet, based on the current and historic body of work,
clear pathways to proceed are presented. The proposed steps in developing these
typologies are:
\begin{compactitem}
\item dimensionality reduction to obtain and describe principal factors 
\item hierarchical clustering (metric learning, fitness, validation)
\item typology nomenclature and characterization, archetype selection
\end{compactitem}




\section{Relevant work in city typologization}
\citet{harris1943functional} empirically classify US cities (metropolitan areas)
based on certain functions, namely: manufacturing, diversification,
transportation, tourism, wholesale, retail, education and mining. Some of the
criteria for classifying where obvious (i.e.\ employment figures were used for
the manufacturing, diversification, wholesale and retail). However, membership
rules were arbitrarily chosen to produce the best resolution. While no
clustering or factor analytical methods were used, this work provides valuable
insight into the earliest methods and reasoning behind city
typologies. References in \citep{harris1943functional} also point to the variety
of empirical urban functional classifications performed around that time on US
cities.

Using trip OD data (obtained from cellphones) on a number of cities in Spain,
\citet{louail2015uncovering} show that work trip patterns (either form home or
random spots) correlate with the population size of a city. They develop an ICDR
(integrated-convergent-divergent-random) OD footprint to characterize urban
mobility. Based on ICDR, they cluster cities hierarchically; four clusters are
generated, with size being the shared attribute among cluster members. They also
apply sensitivity testing to verify the stability of the clustering. An
interesting feature of their work is the grid-partitioning and experiments on
grid resolution effects. Related work in city classification has been done by
\citet{louf2014typology}. However, they focus on typologization of street
patterns, while also introducing a novel method for representing urban road
networks, namely: ``fingerprints.'' Using a distance measure that takes into
account block size and topology, they perform hiearchical clustering to obtain
four groups of city types based on street patterns. \citet{louf2014typology} do
not justify their choice of 4 clusters, two of which are singletons, while
another comprises 78\% of the 131 cities considered. As a limited example of
city typologization \citet{ma2013world} discuss deterritorialization (transfer
of resource control from the state to the private sector) within the context of
the USA, China and Japan, only considering three city-types: market-oriented,
state-oriented and the dual-role types. Their Markov model gives results on
evolutionary patterns in intercity network behavior (based on air traffic
flows). %limited example



\citet{bruce1971developing} motivate the use of factor analysis (PCA) for
correlation studies to condense the number of indicators for
clustering. Following on \citet{hadden1965american}, whose work determined 8
factors for US cities, they classify 83 US cities based on 6 factors with the
highest component loadings: median income, median age, household size,
population, wholesale businesses, manufacturing jobs. Via Ward's method of
hierarchical clustering, the authors determine 13 city types, which is much
larger number than usually obtained from cluster
analyses. \citet{bruce1971developing} argue for the empirical determination of
typologies for usefulness.

The ``300 Cities'' study conducted by \citet{martin2008300} is another relevant
effort. Carried out to aid IRS policy interventions, cities were classified
largely according to socioeconomic factors. Using 5\%-sample data from the
Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), \cite{martin2008300} transformed each city
into a 15-dimensional agent via a binning algorithm.\footnote{Ultimately, this
  is enhanced by a city-matching method to incorporate the effects of
  information diffusion.} The 15 variables could be classified into household
and financial/demographic segments. \cite{martin2008300} employed the Concor
grouping technique (in ORA/SAS) and determined 8 characteristic groups based on
sociodemographic factors, two of which, for example, are: (i) low-density,
highly-educated, new taxpayers, not married, moved recently; (ii) population
over 1.25 million, highly educated kids, large social network. An objective of
their work, which we also share, is the detection of a ``canonical city'' to
represent each cluster to allow for an ``economy of effort.'' They also show,
critically, that regional consideration are inadequate for making policy
decisions.

Similar to the ``300 Cities'' exploration \citep{martin2008300}, the ``City 600''
project conducted by the McKinsey Global Institute \citep{dobb2011urban} attempts
to track the economic power of established and emerging global cities. Data were
gathered for 2007 and then projected to 2025 for this study. Only four main
indicators are considered: population (by age group), GDP (including per
capita), and number of households (in 4 income segments). Thus, no factor
analysis is involved. Also, rather than cluster, \citet{dobb2011urban} simply
rank cities and make comparisons without attempting to typologize.


In a major effort, \citet{priester2013diversity} analyze 41 megacities on a
global scale to determine future mobility characteristics. With up to 59
indicators, they reduce this to 13 distinct factors via factor analysis. Some of
these include: congestion, taxi traffic, public transit usage, parking charges,
among others. We note that they do not consider climate, weather, or economic
factors. The seven typologies that emerge are: paratransit, auto, non-motorized,
hybrid, traffic-saturated, transit and the singleton, Manila. The transit cities
are found the advanced economies of East Asia, while the paratransit types are
in the emerging economies of Africa and South America. The authors go into great
detail in describing the typologies. \citet{priester2013diversity} hold that
even though this work is based on data collected in 1995\footnote{The UITP
  Millenium Cities Database for Sustainable Transport (Kenworthy and
  Laube). \citet{zegras2005sustainable} also performed a factor analysis of the
  cities in this same dataset.}, the group definitions are bound to be stable
over the coming years although membership might change.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Dimensionality reduction}
A variety of indicators exist for urban data across various dimensions, e.g.\
social, economic, cultural, demographic, and so forth. One of the main
challenges in identifying typologies based on these indicators is the
dimensionality of the available data. Factor analysis has been established as an
effective means of condensing this dimensionality, effectively reducing the
indicators to fundamental factors that can be further described based on the
nature of the correlations of the indicators to the factors
determined.\footnote{Principal component analysis (PCA), introduced by
  \citet{pearson1901lines}, is the predominant approach in factor analysis.}
\citet{price1942factor} demonstrated its use in analyzing 93 cities based on 15
initial variables from which four factors were deduced. \citet{martin1987factor}
further exhibited its use in typologizing cooperate customer behavior based on
numerous survey indicators.




\subsection{Brief overview of hierarchical clustering}
Hierarchical clustering has been shown to be effective at pattern recognition,
particularly because it is unsupervised and thus requires to predefined
assumptions on the nature of the data \citep{jain1999clustering,
  jain2010data}. Given a separation metric between elements in a
multidimensional set, hiearchical clustering proceeds by iteratively
agglomerating groups based on various criteria (e.g.\ Ward's method, method of
averages (UPGMA), single linkage, among others). A corresponding dendrogram can
be generated to indicate the structure of the grouping.

While the clustering method of choice tends to be empirically chosen, a fitness
test specifically for this purpose has been proposed by
\citet{merigot2010goodness}. In addition to selecting the clustering method, the
other important question is number of relevant or useful clusters in the
dataset. Various heuristics have been used in the past. In particular, the
``elbow/knee'' criterion \citep{tibshirani2001estimating,salvador2004determining}
which indicates the number of clusters beyond which no meaningful improvement in
group compactness can be observed has been used. However,
\citet{tibshirani2001estimating} introduced an effective means for determining
the optimal cluster number called the ``gap test,'' which has been established,
although another interesting has since been proposed \citep{sugar2003finding}.

Another issue that must be resolved in hierarchical clustering is the choice of
separation metric. The Euclidean distance is commonly used, but other
candidates, such as the Manhattan distance, can be appropriate. A learning
approach has also been introduced \citep{xing2003distance} to infer a metric
best suited to the data being analyzed. Regardless of which metric is chosen,
obtaining a dissimilarity matrix is straightforward if data are available in all
the dimensions being considered. While preprocessing heuristics can be employed
to fill missing data before clustering, the dynamic time warping approach
\citep{bellman1959adaptive, sakoe1978dynamic, giorgino2009computing} offers a
robust matching algorithm for alignment to produce the optimal dissimilarity
matrix.\footnote{Factor analysis should eliminate the prospect of missing data,
  since each element should have a score for each factor, assuming all (or some)
  of the contributing indicators are available for that element to begin with.}

\section{Significance of contribution}
The novelty of our contribution will lie in the fact that we will include
geographical, health and environmental indicators in our analyses. These have
never before been considered in the extant urban typologization
literature. Consequently, our typologies will feature a ``robust'' mobility
pattern identification, which is not only limited to transit conditions, but
also energy use, emissions and health factors. Notably, we will also make use of
the latest data as much as possible, given that most recent work in this area by
\citet{priester2013diversity} uses baseyear data from 1995. 

\subsection{Questions}
Temporal considerations are yet to be determined. However, trends could be
included in the clustering procedure and these could be a factor in the
groupings. But there are other interesting questions that arise. For instance,
is there enough data to observe the evolution of clusters over two or three
periods?
