Major steps in conversion:

1. Create nodes
2. Process the turning information
3. Create polylines for turnings
4.



Other notes:
1. How were the long segments handled? Some sectiosn from base have a length > 4km
2. Do all segments in a link need to be of same category  ('A','B' etc.)?
3. Information on lanes: canstop, capark, shoulder, hov. What do these variables mean for midterm?
4. Difference between road_type and category in links
5. Check sequence of segments in links
6. DFS or BFS?
7. Who wrote the Access database functions?
8. Lane polylines: HOw to connect the offsets when the transfer is not smooth. Should this correction be made at the segment connections too
9. Multiple points with same x,y in a polylane
10. Add trueconnector Flag
11. What do node types represent?
12. Need to copy the nodes too; not just link when dealing with bi-directional links

Things to do when intermediate nodes are removed:
1. The section geometry should be extended
    a. Add the node-point to both the sections
    b. The lane-connections at the node-point
2. The segments-to-link must take care of these nodes while exploration     


Things to handle later:
1. U-trns
2. Run SUMO after the clean up of the nodes
3. Th node in a connections should connect links such that the hnode and tnode are equal to the node
4. Check the length of the link and freeflow TT calculation
5. Some lanes (and segments) are no being displayed : eg 299101
6. The list of lanes without downstream connections
7. Some keys are int and some are strings. Connections are pair of ints and everythign else is string. Be consistent


Notable assumptions
1. U-turns are generally allowed
2.
